== Description ==

MailBard is currently a work in progress!  Thank you for your patience.

MailBard is a fork of the plugin MailPoet 2.  The MailPoet team has decided to stop support MailPoet 2; MailBard will pick up where MailPoet 2 left off.  We are striving for 100% backwards-compatibility with MailPoet 2.

More details will be added soon.  To contribute or ask questions, please visit us at http://www.mailbard.com/.
